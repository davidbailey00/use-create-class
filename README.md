# useCreateClass

## What is it?

A React Hook that allows you to get that old-time nostalgic feeling of createClass, while using modern, functional React components.

## How?

See `script.js` for example usage - roughly follows the [standard React class APIs](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-without-es6.html), without unsafe functions. Run `yarn dev` to try it out.

## Why?

Going to quote [@walaura](https://github.com/walaura) here, whose similar work inspired me to create this monstrosity:
